# can-you-draw

**Version 2.0.0**

This is a game built upon the same functions as my last one, Draw This. However, this is a more revamped
and stylized version. This one provides more tools, features, and a more grounded retro aesthetic. The first thing at hand was to establish
that old school look I wanted and that was by making the borders and screen look like a old bulky computer from the 90's. Next, was to make some new
assets that were easier to draw. Another task at is to add some challenge, uniqueness, and a more appealing play screen. However, I don't want
to make the game feel modern. The whole subject of this game is for it be old-school, and retro. So keeping the layout simple isn't due to the lack of ability
, but meant to serve as simple colors, shapes, and function.


Day 1:
 Finding out what I can change, change the concept, change certain functions,
 make it challenging, still keep it fun, but not too easy

Day 2: Figuring out what controls to add for the game along with changing up the
layout for the play screens.
