# can-you-draw?

**Version 2.0.0**

A Process:

Day 1:
 Finding out what I can change, change the concept, change certain functions,
 make it challenging, still keep it fun, but not too easy

Day 2: Figuring out what controls to add for the game along with changing up the
layout for the play screens.

Day 3: Adding and recoding new levels and adding them within my game statement.
Also creating a escalation in difficulty for each level. As the user progresses the
the drawings get harder to recreate.

Day 4:
Created assets and implementing them within my code. Making sure that they're cropped
and proportional within the space. Ensuring the assets are drawable for the user using 
just one line. Keeping things simple and clean.

Artist Statement:

For this I had decided to further continue on a project I had done earlier this year. This was the first time
in making a game and I wanted it to be something I could make within a reasonable time frame, was simple,
user friendly, and related to what I prefer to do as an artist, which is draw. Personally, I am not 
an artist who likes to code, but rather draw on a digital space or pen and paper. I really enjoyed pictionary as
a child and wanted to do a game based off of that. There are many popular drawing/pen based games that have 
gained user's within a five year timespan. Examples being Skirbblio and Gartic Phone. I took inspiration from that
when it came to format/design. However, I wanted to apply my own challenge to it. So the game is simple. The user
will go through several different levels where they will have to redraw the image shown within the canvas. The challenge
is that the drawings the user will have to replicate will escalate in difficulty and will only be able to do them in one line.
The user will have to clear the canvas per drawing and at the end it will assess whether or not the user can draw or not. This
is supposed to be a fun, simple, and easy game that anyone can win at. Or is it? You tell me.
